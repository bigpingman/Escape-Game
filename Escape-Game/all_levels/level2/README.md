# Level 2

The player is shown a grid of squares and a highlighted pattern of squares in that grid (represented in the code by a 2D array). The highlighted squares become unlighted after a short period of time. The player must then recreate the pattern of highlighted squares from memory to win. If the player fails to do so in three tries, the time limit is reduced by x seconds.

## Quick Start

`python memory.py`

*Note:* This game is not really playable without a gui, so all we have here is a method to generate random patterns for a given N x M dimension.
